    <h1>The Best Movies According to Happymore</h1>
    <h2>My top series of all time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>24</h3>
    <p>The unpredictability of what's going to happen next is what makes 24 unique for me. I love intelligence and investigative movies and this series did it for me.<br />
        Favorite character: Jack Baeur
    </p>

    <h3>Prison Break</h3>
    <p>Prison Break is no different from 24 in making it difficult to predict what's going to happen next. It kep me thrilled.</p>

    <h3>Prey</h3>
    <p>Unlike 24, Prey is more of an adventurous and wildlife tv show. Yes, it also nailed it. It kept me suspended all the way.</p>
